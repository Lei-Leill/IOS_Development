## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Instagram: Simple and intuitive photo/video sharing interface; Fun and easy-to-use image filters

BeReal: Encourages authentic (Front and back camera usage for realism), spontaneous posting; Daily posting reminders

Forest: Help me focus

I want to do a SnapConnect: a photo and video sharing app inspired by Instagram, aimed at creating a clean, minimal social space for media interaction. Users can create profiles, follow others, and share content to a scrolling feed. The app includes real-time interaction via likes, comments, and chat features, with optional filters for creative editing. The goal is to balance simplicity with core social functionality.
